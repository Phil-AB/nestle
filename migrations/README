## Usage

### Create a new migration (auto-generate from model changes):
```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description of changes"
```

### Create a blank migration:
```bash
alembic revision -m "description"
```

### Apply migrations (upgrade to latest):
```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

### Rollback one migration:
```bash
alembic downgrade -1
```

### View current migration version:
```bash
alembic current
```

### View migration history:
```bash
alembic history --verbose
```

## Notes

- This configuration uses async SQLAlchemy with asyncpg
- Database URL is loaded from .env file via src/utils/config.py
